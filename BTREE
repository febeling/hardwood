Split Node
  find median key
  move median key to parent
  remove node as child from parent
  create 2 new nodes
    move keys to 2 new nodes (upper, lower)
    move childs to 2 new nodes (upper, lower)
  insert 2 new nodes as childs into parent

Number of childs = Number Keys + 1

New parent key: 2          [1, 2*, 3]
New parent childs: 2, 3  [1, 2*, 3*, 4]
